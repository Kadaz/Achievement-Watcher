⚠️ The github issue tracker is not a piracy helpdesk 🙃
I would like to remind you that I do not endorse piracy. AW's purpose is merely educational.

💡 Did you try to find the answer in the readme and or wiki ? If no then please have a quick look.

💡 Did you search the issue tracker for a similar question ? If no then please do a quick search.

Ok so now, please do ask you question 😇
