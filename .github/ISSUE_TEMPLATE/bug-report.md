‚ö†Ô∏è The github issue tracker is not a piracy helpdesk üôÉ
I would like to remind you that I do not endorse piracy. AW's purpose is merely educational.
They are other places to discuss _"how to make x game work"_. Unless it directly concerns AW's ability to parse achievement in this case please do speak up.
